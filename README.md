# Developmental DNA methylation dynamics in buff-tailed bumblebee drones

This project is a collaboration with Dr. Ben Hunt (University of Exeter, UK), Dr. Mirko Pegoraro (Liverpool John Moores University, UK) and Dr. Eamonn Mallon (University of Leicester, UK). We identifiy genome-wide and gene-level differences in DNA methylation throughout bumblebee development.
